I'll help you create a clean, well-structured to-do list app with React. Let me first examine the current project structure to see what's already set up.

Read file: package.json

Read file: index.html

Ran tool

Read file: src/main.jsx
Great! I can see this is a Vite + React project that's already set up. For styling, I'll choose **Tailwind CSS** as it provides excellent utility classes for rapid development and is easy to configure with Vite. Let me set up the to-do list app with the requested structure.

First, let's install Tailwind CSS and set it up:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
Let me try a different approach to initialize Tailwind:

```bash
npm run build
```
Let me create the Tailwind config files manually since the npx command didn't work:




Now let's update the CSS file to include Tailwind directives:


Now let's create the component structure. First, I'll create a components directory:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components
```
Now let's create the individual components. First, the `TodoItem` component:


Now let's create the `AddTodoForm` component:


Now let's create the `TodoList` component:


Now let's create a custom hook for managing todo state:


Let me create the hooks directory first:

```bash
mkdir -p src/hooks
```
Now let's recreate the useTodos hook in the correct location:

Now let's update the main `App.jsx` component to use our new todo components and hooks:


Let's update the HTML title:


Now let's create a comprehensive README.md file:


Let's test the application to make sure everything works:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Let's also clean up by removing the unused CSS file:

Ran tool
Let's create a simple example test to show how testing could be set up:


Let me create the test directory structure first:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components/__tests__
```




Let's test the build to make sure everything compiles correctly:

```bash
npm run build
```
I need to install the correct PostCSS plugin for Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
```
Now let's update the PostCSS configuration:


Let me check the current PostCSS config:

Read file: postcss.config.js


Now let's try building again:

```bash
npm run build
```
The build succeeded but there's a warning about unknown utility classes. This might be because we're using a newer version of Tailwind. Let me check what version we have and update the configuration:

```bash
npm list tailwindcss
```
I see we have Tailwind CSS v4, which has a different configuration format. Let me update the configuration files:


Let me check the current Tailwind config:

Read file: tailwind.config.js
Let me try a different approach. For Tailwind v4, we might need to use a simpler CSS approach. Let me update the CSS file:


Now let's test the build again:

```bash
npm run build
```
Great! The build is now successful. Let's start the development server to test the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive todo list application with all the requested features. Here's a summary of what I've built:

## 🎉 Todo App Complete!

### ✅ **Features Implemented:**
- **Add new todos** - Form with validation and empty input prevention
- **Mark tasks as complete/incomplete** - Checkbox toggle functionality
- **Delete tasks** - Individual delete buttons for each todo
- **Filter todos** - View All, Active, or Completed tasks
- **Progress tracking** - Shows completion statistics and percentage
- **Persistent storage** - Data saved in localStorage
- **Responsive design** - Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS

### 🏗️ **Clean Component Structure:**
- **`AddTodoForm`** - Handles new todo input with validation
- **`TodoItem`** - Individual todo component with toggle/delete actions
- **`TodoList`** - Container with filtering and statistics
- **`useTodos`** - Custom hook for state management and localStorage persistence

### 🎨 **Styling Choice: Tailwind CSS**
I chose Tailwind CSS for its:
- **Rapid development** - Utility-first approach
- **Consistency** - Predefined design system
- **Customization** - Easy to extend and modify
- **Performance** - Only includes used styles in production

### 📁 **Project Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── AddTodoForm.jsx    # Form for adding new todos
│   ├── TodoItem.jsx       # Individual todo item component
│   ├── TodoList.jsx       # List container with filtering
│   └── __tests__/         # Example test files
├── hooks/
│   └── useTodos.js        # Custom hook for todo state management
├── App.jsx                # Main app component
├── main.jsx               # React entry point
└── index.css              # Tailwind CSS styles
```

### 🚀 **Ready to Use:**
The application is now running on `http://localhost:5174` (as shown in your terminal output). You can:

1. **Add todos** by typing in the input field and clicking "Add Todo"
2. **Toggle completion** by clicking the checkboxes
3. **Delete todos** using the red "Delete" buttons
4. **Filter todos** using the All/Active/Completed buttons
5. **Clear completed** todos with the "Clear Completed" button
6. **See progress** with the completion percentage display

### 📚 **Documentation:**
- **Comprehensive README.md** with installation, setup, and customization instructions
- **Inline comments** explaining non-obvious logic
- **JSDoc comments** for all components and functions
- **Example test file** showing how to add automated testing

### 🔧 **Easy to Extend:**
The modular architecture makes it simple to add features like:
- Categories/tags
- Due dates
- Priority levels
- Search functionality
- Drag & drop reordering

The app is production-ready with proper error handling, accessibility features (ARIA labels), and a clean, maintainable codebase!
